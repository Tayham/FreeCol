### Improvements

*  Additional Test Cases can be found in the tests/towson folder and are incorporated into the build
*  Code has been extensively refactored using a variety of tools including SonarLint, AutoRefactor, CodePro, manual extraction, and many others..
*  Implemented JavaDocs, Testing Reports, and JArchitect visualizations of complexity which are all located in their corresponding folders in the build directory.
*  Adding a cool feature that lets you build mountains anywhere. Who doesn't like an unfair tactical advantage?
